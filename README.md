# SWGoH Territory Battle History - Excel Workbook
An Excel Workbook for Windows and Mac that takes the csv file created by Hotbot's tbstats command and automatically converts it into an Excel Workbook for archiving, reviewing and tracking purposes. It offers several settings for customizing how the new tables are generated into the new archived workbook, including where the new Workbook will go, what to name it, and what to do with the tbstats file after the conversion.
